# ServoPoint_675
DIY project of simple **[DCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Command_Control) Accessory decoder** for servo controlled point.

This project is based on [ServoPoint by Paco CaÅ„ada](http://usuaris.tinet.cat/fmco/home_en.htm) (with optocoupler)

The goal of the project is to improve the device by adding 2 configuration buttons. For this purpose, instead of the PIC12F629 processor, the **Microchip  PIC12F675** processor is used, whose analog input supports additional buttons.
